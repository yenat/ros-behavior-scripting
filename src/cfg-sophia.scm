; Behavior Tree configuration parameters for the Sophia blender model.

; The configuration controls her "personality": the kinds of
; expressions she shows on her face, how intensely she shows them,
; how long she shows them for. It also controls the probability
; of her reacting in certain ways to situations, or doing certain
; things in given situations.

; --------------------------------------------------------
; Emotional-state to expression mapping. For a given emotional state
; (for example, happy, bored, excited) this specifies a range of
; expressions to display for that emotional state, as well as the
; intensities and durations.
;
; Columns (in order) are:
; * expression (emotion) class
; * blender emotion animation name
; * probability of selecting this animation from this class
; * min intensity of expression
; * max intensity of expression
; * min duration of expression
; * max duration of expression
;
; To view the available expressions, do this:
; rostopic echo /blender_api/available_emotion_states
; ['worry', 'happySurprise', 'happy.001', 'recoil', 'happyDisgust', 'happy',
; 'surprisedSad', 'surprised', 'sad', 'irritated', 'happy.002', 'fearSuprise',
; 'fear', 'engaged', 'disgustSurprise', 'disgust.Sad', 'disgust', 'contempt',
; 'confused', 'comprehending', 'bored', 'awe', 'angrySad', 'angryDisgust',
; 'angry', 'amused', 'none']
